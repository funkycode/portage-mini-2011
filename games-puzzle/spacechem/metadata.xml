		SpaceChem is a puzzle game from Zachtronics Industries. The
		player is tasked with synthesizing chemicals which are used to
		power reactors. This is achieved by creating a circuit along
		which various command nodes are placed, such as those used for
		triggering atomic fusion or fission, and through which atoms
		and molecules ultimately travel through on their way to their
		destinations.

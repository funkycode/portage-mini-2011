		vitunes is a curses-based music player and playlist manager for *nix whose goals are: 
		1. a minimalistic appearance, 2. strong vi-like bindings, and 3. quick playlist creation/management. 
		vitunes does not strive to be a feature-rich media player, but rather a quick, vi-like media indexer 
		and playlist manager, that just happens to be able to play the music it indexes

# Group python-3-specific ebuilds here - they should
# all be masked for now to avoid situations where
# deps cannot be satisfied due to python-3 not being
# available. We want the python-2 version of the
# ebuild to be the most recent for stable and 
# unstable to avoid this problem:

# If you want to use mysql-community, unmask it and mask dev-db/mysql.
# Having both unmasked causes "emerge dev-db/mysql" to fail, which is
# not optimal.

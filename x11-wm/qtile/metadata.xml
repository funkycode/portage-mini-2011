  <longdescription lang="en">
    A full-featured, pure-Python tiling window manager.
	Simple, small and extensible. It's easy to write your own
	layouts, widgets and built-in commands. It is configured entirely
	in Python, it has a command-line shell that allows all aspects of
	QTile to be manipulated and spected. QTile has a complete remote
	scriptability - so write scripts to set up workspaces, manipulate
	windows, update status bar widgets and more. It's scriptability has
	made thorough unit testing possible, making it one of the best-tested
	window managers around.
	Since it is QTile's aim to stay out of your way, you wouldn't see many
	screenshots, as there is usually nothing to show off in a screenshot.
